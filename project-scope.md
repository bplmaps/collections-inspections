## Project Questions

1. Physical size -- what is the physical size of each object? How can we visualize it?
2. What's the range of bounding box diversity?
3. Who are the creators / publishers of the maps?
4. What do the notes say and what can we learn from them / what patterns emerge in notes, among collections / topics, and maybe what looking through the notes can tell us about librarianship practices?
5. How do our collections change over time?
6. What is the geography of our cartographic collections? What areas are heavily represented? What does this tell us about curatorial choices we have to make as librarians?
7. What three dimensional items are represented in our collections?
8. What kinds of colors are represented across our collections?

Let's try to prioritize 1) physical size thing, and 2) random map generator, e.g., generate 5 maps and provide similar maps

## Methods for answering this stuff
1. Circle packing or hierarchical bubble chart for subject/topics
2. Call numbers as a way of going about how cartogaphic information is organized by way of this collection
3. Title length against time -- a lot of this is a function of cataloguing standards, which might itself be a fun way to chart changes in metadata

## General Collections To Do

1. Sitting down with Lauren or Danny to do a metadata walkthrough
2. Establish a set of project questions

### workflow for acquiring data

0. Specify file structure for project questions
1. Pull down all items from digi coll w/ modified script from Garrett -- downloading json data & getting it into a tsv
2. Doing some interpretation -- did we miss anything? Did it all transport okay -- what anomalies exist in the dataset? What tools can we use to
3. What are tools / libraries that we can use to answer the project questions (e.g., physical size)
